# Getting Started with Create React App

Objective
The objective of this iteration is to continue implementing functionality using the React features that have been recently learned. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following tasks:

Implement a temperature unit toggle switch utilizing React context.
Establish a profile page route employing React Router.
Enable form submission utilizing controlled components or refs.
Set up a mock server and develop code to make API calls to it. This mock server will replicate the behavior of the backend that will be constructed in Sprint 12.
Implementation Details

1. Temperature Unit Toggle Switch
   In this task, we will create a toggle switch component that allows users to switch between different temperature units. We will utilize React context to manage the state globally within our application, ensuring consistent access to the chosen temperature unit across various components.

2. Profile Page Route
   To implement the profile page route, we will integrate React Router into our application. This will enable navigation to a dedicated profile page, providing users with a personalized experience. The profile page will showcase relevant user information and preferences.

3. Form Submission
   For form submission functionality, we have the option to utilize controlled components or refs based on the specific requirements of our application. Controlled components offer a more declarative approach, while refs provide direct access to form elements. We will choose the method that best aligns with our project's needs.

4. Mock Server and API Calls
   To simulate backend interactions during development, we will set up a mock server. This server will emulate the behavior of the actual backend that will be developed in Sprint 12. By making API calls to the mock server, we can test and validate our application's frontend functionality without relying on the backend infrastructure.

Getting Started
